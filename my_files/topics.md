# Shorts Ideas

I think it would be a good marketing strategi to do some videos about the following topics:

* The japanese writing systems
* Kanji Reform (and why it is a mess)
* History of kanji
* What is unicode
* Unicode and why many characters have multiple entries
* Unicode and why characters change size depending on other characters. try removing inside brackets: (卄) | 艹
* Unicode and why you cannot put () after ⿓ in code.
* Why japanese is twice as hard to learn as other languages
